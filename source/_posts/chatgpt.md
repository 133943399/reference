## Overview
### Terminology
- Prompt: input text that guides an AI model‚Äôs response.
- Tokens: the smallest units of text processed by an AI model.
- Token Limit: the max number of tokens an AI model can process in one request.
- Artificial intelligence (AI): machines that imitate human intelligence.
- AI Model: a program trained on datasets to recognize patterns and make decisions without human intervention.
- Large language model (LLM): a transformer-based AI model trained on large text datasets to understand and generate human-like language.
- Hallucination: when an AI model generates responses that are false or misleading but presented as fact.

### Tips
Efficiency
- Focus on achieving the desired output efficiently with minimal words in the prompt.
- Specify general instructions at the start of a conversation or when changing direction to avoid constantly restating them in each new prompt.
```{.wrap}
Example: specify the role once at the start of a conversation.
```
- Restructure text to eliminate filler words that don‚Äôt add meaning:
```{.wrap}
Example: ‚Äúprovide a breakdown" -> "provide sales breakdown‚Äù.
```
- Do not explicitly refer to the item being processed unless addressing a specific part of it as what you provide will typically speak for itself:
```{.wrap}
Example: ‚ÄúFilter this piece of text" -> "Filter text‚Äù
```
- Do not explicitly ask the AI for help:
```{.wrap}
Example: ‚Äúcan you help me x‚Äù.
```
- Do not explicitly reference yourself unless clarifying multiple entities:
```{.wrap}
Example: "do X for me".
Example: ‚ÄùI want to x‚Äù.
```
- Do not be polite to the AI:
```{.wrap}
Example: "please do X".
Example: ‚Äúthanks‚Äù.
```

Clarify
- Consider breaking up complex ideas into granular bullet points to improve clarity, avoid searching for text, and eliminate comma lists and conjunctions (e.g., and).
- Avoid vague or close ended questions.
```{.wrap}
Example: ‚ÄúDo you think our site is good" -> "Explain flaws in the designs of each webpage‚Äù
```
- Ensure prompts are specific
```{.wrap}
Example: ‚Äúexplain our sales" -> "explain a breakdown of our sales performance for the last quarter‚Äù.
```

Refine
- If the AI model misunderstands your request then specify the intended action.
- Provide sufficient context so the AI model can understand the scenario.

Privacy
- Never share sensitive information with AI model's as you can't be certain how it's stored, whether it will be shared, of if a data breach may occur.
